# My first fullstack React delivery app

Hey my friends! This is my 3 days marathon I guess, I spent 28 hours for doing this test task. It still has a lot of mistakes, the cart doesn't get data from database, a lot of issues with design and so on.<br>
But this task is here because I wanna remind everyone that we all started with non-perfect things. I will be better developer in some time and this journey will take my whole life. It actually doesn't scare me. I'm gonna deal with it.
